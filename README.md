# Restaurant-Webpage
The Restaurant Webpage project is a static website developed using HTML and CSS. 
The webpage serves as an online presence for a restaurant, providing information about the restaurant's menu, location, and contact information. 
The website is designed with a responsive layout to ensure that it can be viewed on different devices, and it includes interactive features 
such as a sign in form. The CSS styling for the webpage is organized using a modular approach, with separate files for the layout, typography, 
and color scheme. The project also includes image files used for the webpage design.
